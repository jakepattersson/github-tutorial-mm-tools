HICCUP (V.O.)
          This, is Berk. It's twelve days
          North of hopeless, and a few
          degrees South of freezing to death.
          It's located solidly on the
          meridian of misery.
          The camera drifts over rolling hills to reveal a small
          village nestled on an outcropping of sea mounts.

          My village. In a word, sturdy.
          And it's been here for seven
          generations, but every single
          building is new.
          The camera drifts closer, circling.

          We have fishing, hunting, and a
          charming view of the sunsets. The
          only problems are the pests. You
          see, most places have mice or
          mosquitos. We have...
          Sheep graze peacefully on a hillside. Suddenly one is
          snatched.

          INT. STOICK'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          A door is pulled open... as a DRAGON swoops directly toward
          it, BLASTING FIRE. The door is SLAMMED. The fire shoots
          through the slats of wood, illuminating HICCUP, a gangly
          teenage Viking.
